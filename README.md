JTC490-final
============

Final interactive infographic project for JTC 490

As a final for my information design class, this will be an interactive graphic about the minimum wage in Colorado, since it will increase effective Jan. 1, 2015 (good news peg?). I'll be using <strike>Highcharts and Google spreadsheets to import data.</strike> Just kidding. I tried D3 for the first time. Meaning, I followed a number of tutorials to make this happen. Heavily annotated to show I mostly know what is going on in the js code. I think I got an A for effort on the project...
